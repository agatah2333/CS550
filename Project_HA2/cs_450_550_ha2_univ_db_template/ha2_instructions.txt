NOTES:
--> Python is required to produce the main answers
--> Zorba is required to check your produced answers with the correct answer
--> cx-oracle is required to connect to Oracle DB only. 
--> So, if you have problem installing anything other than the base python, you can try finishing the algebra and calculus part first
--> SQL solution requires VPN to GMU network similar to the way Oracle SQL Developer requires it
--> For SQL solution, set your username and password provided in solution_sql/credentials.py
	--> This requires the oracle password not the masonlive password!
--> A sample of answers for questions covered in class is provided in respective folders as: class_example_<type>.<ext>
--> A sample of runs for questions covered in class is provided in respective folders as: class_example_test_<type>.py
--> Your views must have exactly the same name and the same column names ordered by as specified in the question
--> The files you need to edit and fill are:
	--> solution_algebra/ha2lib_algebra.py
	--> solution_calculus/ha2lib_calculus.py
	--> solution_sql/sql_views.sql
--> You might need Atom or similar json friendly interface to peruse/understand your answers.json or report.json
--> By default, the answers produced will either be empty (algebra/calculus) or contain bogus answers (sql) 
	--> However, if everything is installed properly, you should some proper output nevertheless.

NOTES for ANSWER FORMAT:
--> All queries must be in queries.sql
--> Do not include a semi-colon(;) in comments in any of the SQL file.
--> Must have semicolon(;) after each command in the SQL file as shown in template.
--> Do not change any of the database files inside the folder `testDBs'
--> Do not change 'create_empty_tables.sql' file or its location
--> testDBs/correct_answers.json has the right answers and your answers.json should contain similar results
--> Do not forget to use DISTINCT where necessary
--> Order matters in solution so order as mentioned in each question
